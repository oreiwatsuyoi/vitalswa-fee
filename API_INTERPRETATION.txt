VitalSwap API Interpretation - Team AlgoNauts

We interpreted the VitalSwap API requirements by creating a comprehensive fee management system with the following approach:

1. FEE DATA STRUCTURE
   - Organized fees by account type (Customer vs Business)
   - Categorized services (Virtual Cards, Transfers, FX, Bank Accounts)
   - Structured with Service, Fee, and Description fields
   - Implemented both static fallback and dynamic API integration

2. REAL-TIME UPDATES
   - Created /api/fee-updates endpoint for live fee synchronization
   - Implemented 5-minute auto-sync intervals
   - Added visual feedback for fee changes with animations
   - Version control system for tracking fee modifications

3. CURRENCY CONVERSION
   - Multi-currency support (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, CHF, CNY, NGN)
   - Real-time exchange rate integration
   - Fallback to static rates when API unavailable
   - Dynamic fee calculation across currencies

4. AUTOMATION FEATURES
   - Dynamic pricing engine based on market conditions
   - User behavior analytics with heatmap tracking
   - Smart notification system with VAPID push notifications
   - Automated content management for FAQ and compliance

5. USER EXPERIENCE

The system transforms basic fee data into an intelligent, automated platform that provides transparent pricing with real-time updates and comprehensive user analytics.
